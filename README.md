<h1 align=center>Chrono Trigger — Nintendo Switch port</h1>

</div>

This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of *Chrono Trigger*
(`com.square_enix.android_googleplay.chrono`, v2.1.5). It loads the original game
binaries, patches them and runs them: we natively run the original Android `.so`
files inside a minimal emulated Android environment.

### How to install

You're going to need the **`.apk`** for version 2.1.5. From it you need:
* `lib/arm64-v8a/libchrono.so` — the engine
* `lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so` — the C++ runtime it depends on
* the **entire `assets/` folder** — the game data (`resources.bin`, `001.dat`…
  `008.dat`, `007-en.dat`, `Shaders/`, `build_date.txt`)

To install:
1. Create a folder called `ct` in the `switch` folder on your SD card.
2. From your `.apk`, extract **`lib/arm64-v8a/libchrono.so`** to `/switch/ct/`.
3. From your `.apk`, extract **`lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`** to `/switch/ct/`.
4. From your `.apk`, copy the **whole `assets/` directory** to `/switch/ct/assets/`.
5. Copy **`ct_nx.nro`** into `/switch/ct/`.

### Notes

This will not work in applet/album mode. Use a game override (hold R on a title)
or a forwarder, so the homebrew gets the full memory and required syscalls.

Save data, the cocos2d-x `Cocos2dxPrefsFile.txt` settings store and the port's
`config.txt` are kept in `/switch/ct/`.

### Configuration

`config.txt` is created on first run:
* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; `-1` picks 1280x720
  handheld and 1920x1080 docked.
* `language` — selects the in-game text/assets: one of `en fr de it es ja ko zh`.
  Anything other than `ja` uses the localized (`-en`) data. Defaults to English.

### How to build

You're going to need devkitA64 and the following devkitPro packages:
* `switch-mesa`
* `switch-libdrm_nouveau`
* `switch-sdl2`
* `switch-freetype`
* `switch-libpng`
* `switch-harfbuzz`
* `switch-ffmpeg` (+ its codec deps `switch-dav1d`, `switch-libopus`,
  `switch-libvorbisidec`, `switch-libwebp`, `switch-libogg`)
